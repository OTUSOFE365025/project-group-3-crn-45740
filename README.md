Business Case:


The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) aims to provide universities with enhanced communication and accessibility by providing a shared conversational interface for students, lecturers, and administrative staff. By utilizing AI-driven natural language processing, AIDAP enables users to retrieve academic schedules, deadlines, announcements, and analytics effectively.


The platform simplifies information retrieval, reduces administrative overhead, and guides decision-making through data analytics. Students benefit from timely notifications and personalized dashboards. Lecturers can set reminders automatically and view course analytics. Administrators can monitor usage, broadcast messages, and enforce institutional policy compliance.


At the business level, AIDAP improves institutional efficiency, enables scalability to thousands of users, and improves student satisfaction. Integration with existing university systems (LMS, registration, calendar, and e-mail) minimizes manual processes and enables continuous improvement through data-driven insights and feedback loops.
